ME35 Midterm

First, run the image processing code in opencv to determine whether it is red or green. 

Then, send the color to airtable using the send-color-to-airtable code. 

Then run the computer-code to send the color to this adafruit dashboard: https://io.adafruit.com/juliadivan/dashboards/me35-midterm

Run the connect wifi code on the pico to connect it to wifi

Then run the pico code to make the butterfly box work. The accel.py and servo.py are both libraries that are used in this code to help run the servo and take accelerometer readings. They were created by Elijah and Chris Tilton respectively.
